				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Campbell Hunter: While the original opus of this assignment was just us messing around with different generative tiling patterns, once we found some inspiration through those patterns, I honestly had a ton of fun. This was the first assignment that actually gave me an opportunity to bust out Procreate and draw up some spritesheets, so that alone is a huge plus. Other than that, the manner in which we collaborated on this assignment was slightly more hectic, but it felt like the final product was made larger simply because getting there took a bit more detective work (Good lord do we all need to start commenting out our code.) Whatever the case, I love my little reporter man, and I’m looking forward to working more in the realm of design and art when it comes to this course.</p>
				<p>Phineas Asmelash: Enter reflection here.</p>
				<p>Vivian Allen: I was mostly in charge of porting over Phineas’s code basis for the black and white, and triangle visuals over into the infinite generating glitch example. This is the first time I have had to significantly refactor code, and it was an interesting experience. Admittedly I was bashing my head against the wall for the first black and white world and thankfully Campbell figured it out for me, and using his work to help refactor the triangle world made a world of difference in my understanding of how to properly refactor. Other than that, we definitely need to comment more on code, so much time was spent trying to figure out what everything did or meant, and I did not help with that unfortunately. All experience for the next time though.</p>
