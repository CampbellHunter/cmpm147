				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Growing up just a few miles from Big Sky National Reserve, I've always been enamoured by the way Montana's lancape changes with the setting sun. For this assignment, I intended to emulate that using generative design.  
				</p>
				<p>In this example, I was able to make a cohesive genarator using a random seed by storing the random values to use later. That way, the trees, reflections, and snow-topped mountains all follow the same contures making for a more complete picture. Finally, by using a shifting gradient to simulate a sunset, I was able to render the environment in a way that changes the color context as it goes.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Honestly pretty proud of this one. The skyline in particular added a lot to the final product, as when the hue of the sky shifts, it recontextualized the colors used in the foreground.</p>
